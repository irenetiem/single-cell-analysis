Compute the Pearson correlation between true and estimated RFs for each duration to quantify the accuracy of the estimator. The Pearson correlation $\\mathrm{cc}$ is defined as\n",

As in the previous excercise, repeatedly estimate RF parameters for each condition (10 times) but this time also plot the standard deviation of the correlations across the different runs for each condition."

    "What happens if the neural response is related to the filtered stimulus by a nonlinear function  $r = f_\\mathrm{nonlinear}(\\mathbf{k}^T \\mathbf{s})$, e.g., by setting the `f_nonlin` argument in the data generation function to `f_threshold_quadratic` in excercise 1? Why does the linear estimator still provide a reliable estimate of the true RF? What happens if you use a full quadratic nonlinearity and set the `offset` term to 0? For more details, see Sharpee Ann Rev Neurosci (2013) (link in \"Background\" section)."
