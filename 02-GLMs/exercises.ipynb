Compute the Pearson correlation between true and estimated RFs for each duration to quantify the accuracy of the estimator. The Pearson correlation $\\mathrm{cc}$ is defined as\n",

As in the previous excercise, repeatedly estimate RF parameters for each condition (10 times) but this time also plot the standard deviation of the correlations across the different runs for each condition."

    "What happens if the neural response is related to the filtered stimulus by a nonlinear function  $r = f_\\mathrm{nonlinear}(\\mathbf{k}^T \\mathbf{s})$, e.g., by setting the `f_nonlin` argument in the data generation function to `f_threshold_quadratic` in excercise 1? Why does the linear estimator still provide a reliable estimate of the true RF? What happens if you use a full quadratic nonlinearity and set the `offset` term to 0? For more details, see Sharpee Ann Rev Neurosci (2013) (link in \"Background\" section)."

    "Fit the linear-nonlinear model to some simulated data (duration = 100 s). For the exponential nonlinearity, the log-likelihood is a concave function. Thus, the parameters can be found using gradient descent. The scipy package provides the [minimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) function that can be used to **minimize the  negative log-likelihood** (which is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood). The minimize function supports a number of algorithms. As we can explicitly compute the gradient for this type of LNP model, algorithms that make use of the gradient are prefered as they are particularly fast, e.g., `method='Newton-CG'`. The function to compute the gradient need to be passed to the minimize method as a keyword agument: `jac=my_gradient_function`. Initialize the RF parameters using the spike-triggered average (STA)\n",
